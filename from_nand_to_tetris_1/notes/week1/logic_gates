### Logic gates


types:

Elementary (Nand, And, Or, Not, .....)

Composite  (Mux, Adder,......)


### Design of gates (for gate architect)

1)Always design the diagramatixal representation of the circuit
2)Design a truth table



### HDL

HDL is known as hardware descriptive language.

HDL describes the textual(programming?) representaion of chips.

When we say gate it is nothing but a simple chip.

HDL is a functional/ declarative language.

The order of hdl statements is insignificant.

before using a chip you must know its interface.


HDL basic structure

/** comments if any */

CHIP Xor {

	//Interface
	IN	input,input2....;
	OUT	output;

	//Implementation
	PARTS:
	
}




Common HDL's:

VHDL
Verilog



### Chip designing


The players(first approximation):

System architects
Developers

The system architect decides which chips are needed

For each chip, the architect creates

A chip API,
A test script,
A compare file
